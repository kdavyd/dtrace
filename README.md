dtrace
======
This is a collection of useful DTrace scripts written while troubleshooting performance issues at Nexenta Systems. 
For comments, feel free to e-mail Kirill.Davydychev@nexenta.com, but I cannot promise a reply. If you find a bug,
please file a Git issue, and maybe I'll get around to fixing it eventually.

Unless a different license is mentioned in any of the scripts, assume that they are under CDDL, MIT, BSD or whatever 
license that suits you most, and I have not gotten around to actually adding the license information yet. Just keep
the copyright and remember I'm not liable for anything these scripts may do.

Most of the scripts are work in progress, and may change at any time.
